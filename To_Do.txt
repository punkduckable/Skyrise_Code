To do....

Build:
	DONE: Redo lift bolts to prevnet catching. 
	Add lift encoders
	Lighten lift (swap steel with aluminum, nylon)
		Total weight saved: 64 + 73 + 89 + 93 g
	DONE: Fix lower 6 bar main bar (flip around)
		The main bar of the lower 6 bar is bending/warping.
		the bar needs to be flipped around/mounted like the main bar of the upper 6 bar is.
	Redo wiring
	Y axis dummy wheel
	
Programming:
	DONE: Write Auto_Drive task. 
		Use 5pt derivative approximation. Store old error values in an array.
		
	DONE: 	Write Auto_Drive_Assist task.

	DONE: Figure out robot's natural mass/damping
		Create a P loop. Set the P to some value. Set an initial offset.
		Let robot oscillate back and forth. Time periods, decay in amplitude.
		Display these values to debug stream?
		Use these values to find the robots 'natural mass' and 'natural damping'
		values. From this, I should be able to pick a more effective D value (to 
		get perfect critical damping). 
			
	DONE: Add headerfiles for all major functions/tasks! Include these before source files!!!

	DONE: Test robot's natural mass/damping values. See if we can get good critical damping

	DONE: Figure out conversion between encoder ticks and degrees.

	DONE: Update PD_Control structure. Add Error array to the strcut remove Target_Sign 		(make it a local variable in the tasks that use it)!

	DONE: Rewrite Auto_Turn task. MAKE SURE THAT ERROR IS TARGET - ANGLE!!!!

	Write simple Auto_Intake, Auto_Skyrise, Auto_Tail functions.

	Write Tele_Lift task (keep lift straight...)
		This should function the same way that the drive straight task 
	
	Write Auto_Lift, Auto_Lift_Assist tasks

	Improve drive PD constants

	Improve Turn PD constants

	Improve Lift PD constants
