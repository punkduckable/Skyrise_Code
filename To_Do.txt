To do....

Build:
	Add lift encoders
	Lighten lift (swap steel with aluminum, nylon)
	Redo wiring
	Y axis dummy wheel
	
Programming:
	Figure out robot's natural mass/damping
		Create a P loop. Set the P to some value. Set an initial offset.
		Let robot oscillate back and forth. Time periods, decay in amplitude.
		Display these values to debug stream?
		Use these values to find the robots 'natural mass' and 'natural damping'
		values. From this, I should be able to pick a more effective D value (to 
		get perfect critical damping). 

	Write Auto_Drive task. 
		Use 5pt derivative approximation. Store old error values in an array.

	Write simple Auto_Intake, Auto_Skyrise, Auto_Tail functions.

	Figure out conversion between encoder ticks and degrees.

	Write Auto_Drive_Assist task.

	Write Tele_Lift task (keep lift straight... basically drive straight)

	Write Auto_Lift, Auto_Lift_Assist tasks
